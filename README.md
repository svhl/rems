# Rajagiri Event Management System

Simplify event management and activity point tracking for students and teachers at Rajagiri

## Features

REMS offers improved event management over the current system at Rajagiri by addressing shortcomings such as

❌ Event information is entered manually during certificate submission

❌ Each submission requires manual entry of activity points by teachers

❌ Unoptimized design for mobile devices

However, REMS provides a better user experience while maintaining functionality.

✅ Database of event info and activity points present to reduce manual input

✅ Dashboard for viewing past and upcoming events

✅ Responsive user interface for both desktop and mobile
